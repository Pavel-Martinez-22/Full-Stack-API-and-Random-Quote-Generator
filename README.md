<p>Project Title: PHP OOP REST API<p>
<p>
  Description: This project demonstrates my ability to build a PHP-based object-oriented REST API
  for managing quotations, supporting full CRUD operations via GET, POST, PUT, and
  DELETE requests. The backend was developed using PHP and PostgreSQL, with
  environment variables for secure configuration, and deployed to Render after local
  testing with Postman and XAMPP. On the frontend, I used JavaScript, PHP, and CSS to
  fetch and display JSON data returned by the API. JavaScript handles asynchronous
  requests and dynamically injects the content into the appropriate HTML elements. To
  streamline deployment and ensure consistency across environments, I containerized
  the entire application using Docker and deployed it as a web service.
